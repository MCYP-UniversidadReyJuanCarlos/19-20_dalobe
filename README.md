SDS is a tool to detect and implement security best practices over docker containers and images.
The scan can be performed by two ways:
- Dynamic analysis. In this approach, docker containers are scanned looking for potential security issues
by highlighting corrections needed to take into account as well as providing best practices 
for hardening your containers environment. The output is a report with the vulnerabilities found and a proposal
Dockerfile.
- Static analysis. Application can scan in an static way with a Dockerfile as an input. By this way,
the output is a report with the vulnerabilities found and a proposal Dockerfile.
Most of the best practices implemented are based on CIS Docker Benchmark document. To obtain the latest version of this guide, please
